'''Calling a JSON API

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar
to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py. The program will prompt for a location,
contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data,
and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier
that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.
API End Points

To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static
subset of the Google Data:

http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/geojson?
This API uses the same parameters (sensor and address) as the Google API.
This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like.
If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get a list of all of the address values
which can be used with this API.To call the API, you need to provide address that
you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the
urllib.urlencode() fuction as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py'''

import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
import json

# Note that Google is increasingly requiring keys
# for this API
serviceurl = 'http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/geojson?'

while True:
    address = input('Enter location: ')
    if len(address) < 1: break

    url = serviceurl + urllib.parse.urlencode(
        {'address': address})

    print('Retrieving', url)
    uh = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    data = uh.read().decode()
    print('Retrieved', len(data), 'characters')

    try:
        js = json.loads(data)
    except:
        js = None

    if not js or 'status' not in js or js['status'] != 'OK':
        print('==== Failure To Retrieve ====')
        print(data)
        continue

    #print(json.dumps(js, indent=4))

    #lat = js["results"][0]["geometry"]["location"]["lat"]
    #lng = js["results"][0]["geometry"]["location"]["lng"]
    #print('lat', lat, 'lng', lng)
    #location = js['results'][0]['formatted_address']
    placeID=js['results'][0]['place_id']
    print('The place Id of the place',address,'you entered is',placeID)
