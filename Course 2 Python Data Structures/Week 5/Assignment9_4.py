'''9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and
figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages.
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines
as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that
maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a
maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.'''
